This is a mosquito dynamics model for lymphatic filariasis. The population dynamics adapted from White et al. (2011) and the disease dynamics adapted from the Ross-MacDonald Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (S-E-I) model.
Various changes are implemented to mimic the physiological age of female mosquitoes by adding the nulliparous state (N) and parous states based on 10 gonotrophic cycles in disease dynamics according to Clements & Paterson (1981).
Please see Branches for modified model code in order to analyse various parameter values as an input.
